 ## How to use the engine

The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a standard protocol used to communicate with
a chess engine, and is the recommended way to do so for typical graphical user interfaces
(GUI) or chess tools. Alexandria implements the majority of its options as described
in [the UCI protocol](https://www.shredderchess.com/download/div/uci.zip).
